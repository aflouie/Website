<p>This research dives into the diverse landscape of tobacco use and quitting attempts across the United States and Guam. Through comprehensive surveys spanning 2011 to 2019, we unravel the complexities of smoking habits and cessation patterns among different demographic groups. The primary goal is to understand how different tobacco user groups, including cigarette smokers, e-cigarette users, and smokeless tobacco consumers, engage in quitting attempts. We aim to uncover trends, success rates, and influencing factors behind these cessation efforts.</p>
<p>By meticulously analyzing survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we reveal intriguing insights. The findings shed light on distinct cessation trends among various user categories, highlighting nuances in quitting behaviors over time and across geographical regions.</p>
<p>These are figures from my project about tobacco use and quitting attempts. My research looked into how different groups (cigarette, e-cigarette, and smokeless tobacco use) attempted to quit smoking and to see who was more successful. It also looked into how among cigarette smokers, who was able to quit and who were classified as “former users.”</p>
